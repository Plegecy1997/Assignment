 <p style="margin-left: 50px ;"><b>Re: Albert Momo University Application</b>
</p><hr> 
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"> Dear. Mr. Albert Momo,<br><br>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the Starz University’s science faculty to study 
    <br>as part of your <abbr>PhD</abbr> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
 </p>
 <p style="margin-left: 50px;">Starting dates</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 50px">
    We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit 
    <br>us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as 
    <br>follows:
 </p>
 <p style="margin-left: 50px">
     First Semester: 9 October 2022 
    <br>
     Second Semester: 15 January 2023 
    <br>
     Third Semester: 2023 
    <br>
 </p>
 <p style="margin-left: 50px">Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 50px">You can find more information about important university dates on our website.</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 50px; font-size: large;"><b>Subjects of study</b></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 50px">At the Starz University, we have a pretty open-minded research facility - as long as the subjects<br>fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated<br>researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team.Saying that, of the ideas <br>you submitted we were most intrigued by as follows, in order of priority:</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 50px">
    <br>Turning H
    <sub>2</sub>
    O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol ( C
    <sub>14</sub>
    H 
    <sub>12</sub> ) 
   <br>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), 
   <br>when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 10
   <sup>3</sup>
   increasing to 3 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> 
  .) </p>
 <p style="margin-left: 50px">HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 50px">
    So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd 
    <br>expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd 
    <br>need to know? Thanks.
 </p>

   <b>Exotic dance moves</b>
</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 50px">
    Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To 
    <br>answer your question, my favorit dances are as follows, with definitions:
 </p>
 
    <p style="margin-left: 50px">Polynesian chicken</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 80px;">A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village 
    <br>would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 50px;">Icelandic brownian shuffle</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 80px ;">Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice 
    <br>this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling 
    <br>their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow 
    <br>students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 50px; ;">Arctic robot dance</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 80px ;">An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s 
    <br>believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted 
    <br>movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on 
    <br>however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really 
    <br>cold.</p>
 <br>
 <p style="margin-left: 50px"> For more of my research, see my exotic dance research page.</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 50px">Yours Sincerely,</p>
